# RagImplementationWithGPT4o

## Overview

This project is a demonstration of how to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that integrates semantic search with a vector database, enabling a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide contextually relevant and informed responses. The implementation leverages GPT-4 for natural language understanding and generation, coupled with Pinecone for efficient vector search and indexing.

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Utilizes sentence embeddings to perform semantic search over a vector database, retrieving contextually relevant documents to inform the language model's responses.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combines the power of GPT-4 with the retrieved documents to generate accurate and contextually rich answers.

- **Scalable Cloud Deployment**: The project is deployed on AWS using Pinecone's vector database to handle large-scale semantic search operations efficiently.

- **Dynamic Context Integration**: Supports updating context data from Google Drive, enabling the model to stay up-to-date with the latest information.

- **Geoeconomic Insights**: Capable of providing insights on complex topics such as geopolitical risks, economic policies, and global trade dynamics.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for implementing the model and managing various components.

- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Used for loading pre-trained models such as `SentenceTransformer` to generate embeddings.

- **Pinecone**: A vector database that supports efficient semantic search using cosine similarity metrics.

- **Torch (PyTorch)**: Utilized for deep learning operations, enabling GPU acceleration when available.

- **OpenAI GPT-4**: The LLM that generates responses based on retrieved documents and user queries.

- **Google Colab**: The environment for running the project, with support for GPU-based processing.

- **AWS**: Cloud platform for deploying the Pinecone instance and managing computational resources.

- **Google Drive**: Integrated for updating the model’s context data, allowing seamless access to the latest information.

## Installation and Setup

**Clone the Repository**: ```bash git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Semantic-Search-Enhanced-AI.git cd Semantic-Search-Enhanced-AI ```

**Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Python installed, then install the necessary Python packages: ```bash pip install torch sentence-transformers pinecone-client openai ```

**Set Up Pinecone**: - Create an account on

Pinecone(https://www.pinecone.io/) and get your API key. - Configure the Pinecone client with your API key in the `config.py` file or directly in the notebook.

**Google Colab Setup**: - Upload the project files to Google Colab. - Ensure you authenticate with Google Drive if you plan to use it for context updates.

**Running the Model**: - Open the Jupyter notebook in Google Colab. - Run all the cells to set up the environment, create the Pinecone index, and start querying the model.

## Usage

- **Semantic Search**: Input a query, and the model will retrieve relevant documents using the Pinecone index, which are then passed to GPT-4 for generating a response.

- **Context Updates**: Place new documents in the configured Google Drive location, and the model will automatically incorporate this data into its context.

## Example Query

```python query = "What are some of the biggest geopolitical risks we face in the next few years?" ```

Output: ```

Increased Protectionism and Trade Restrictions
Geopolitical Uncertainty and Economic Implications
Fragmentation of Global Financial and Trade Systems ... ```
